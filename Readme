We will be working on the Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System. 
With climate change exacerbating heat-related risks, this system aims to provide timely alerts to the public,
helping them stay safe during extreme heat events. I have done data analysis, developing predictive 
models, and integrating the system with mobile platforms for widespread dissemination of alerts.

# IN Detail

The Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System is designed to keep people safe during extreme heat events by
providing timely alerts on their mobile devices. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity
of heat waves, this system uses data analysis and predictive models to forecast heat-related risks.
By integrating these predictions with mobile platforms, the system can send out alerts to a wide audience,
helping people take necessary precautions to protect their health and well-being during periods of extreme
heat.
Algorithm used are Random Forest Classifier.
